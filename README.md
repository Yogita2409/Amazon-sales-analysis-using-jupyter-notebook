📊 Amazon Sales Report Analysis using Python

📌 Overview

This project analyzes Amazon sales report data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project was to clean the dataset, explore key insights, and visualize the results using different data visualization libraries.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

numpy – numerical computations

pandas – data manipulation & cleaning

matplotlib – data visualization

seaborn – advanced visualization

📂 Steps Performed

Imported Python Libraries

Loaded essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Cleaning

Removed missing/duplicate values.

Handled inconsistent formatting.

Ensured proper data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics.

Explored patterns in the dataset.

Data Visualization

Created bar plots, count plots, and distribution plots.

Example: Count plot of product sizes in the dataset (see below).

📊 Key Insights

Most popular product sizes were M, L, and XL.

Very few sales were observed for 5XL, 6XL, and 4XL sizes.

Data distribution revealed trends helpful for inventory planning.

📌 Future Improvements

Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
Automate data cleaning pipeline.
Extend analysis to include time-series trends.
