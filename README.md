The goal of this project was to clean the dataset, explore key insights, and visualize the results using different data visualization libraries.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
numpy – numerical computations
pandas – data manipulation & cleaning
matplotlib – data visualization
seaborn – advanced visualization

📂 Steps Performed
Imported Python Libraries
Loaded essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Cleaning
Removed missing/duplicate values.
Handled inconsistent formatting.
Ensured proper data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated summary statistics.

📊 Key Insights
Most popular product sizes were M, L, and XL.
Very few sales were observed for 5XL, 6XL, and 4XL sizes.
Data distribution revealed trends helpful for inventory planning.

📌 Future Improvements
Add interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
Automate data cleaning pipeline.
Extend analysis to include time-series trends.
